 * <h2>3. Requirement</h2>
 * <p>
 * An extension that adds support for Forms. Forms are windows that are designed
 * by the end user and can be integrated in languages. They are a simple way to
 * leverage languages by providing a mechanism to integrate user input/output
 * into languages (such as the Cleansheets formulas or macros).</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Use Case 2 - "Forms and Variables":</b> In order for forms to become
 * useful in formulas or macros it is necessary to associate data with the
 * contents of the visual widgets. The mechanism used for that will be the
 * binding of variables (macros or formulas variables) with the contents of the
 * visual widgets. One simple way to achieve this is by using temporary
 * variables (from macros and formulas). The matching between widgets and
 * variables should be done by associating the ones with the same name. When
 * displaying a form (in the context of a macro or a formula), if the temporary
 * variables with the same name of widgets exist, them they are used to set the
 * content of the widgets. For widgets for which no temporary variables with the
 * same name are found then new temporary variables should be created. The user
 * should be able to change the contents of edit boxes. When closing the form
 * window the contents of the temporary variables should be updated from the
 * contents of the corresponding visual widgets.</p>
