 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>-Note: this is a template/example of the individual documentation that each team member must produce each week/sprint. Suggestions on how to build this documentation will appear between '-' like this one. You should remove these suggestions in your own technical documentation-</b>
 * <p>
 * <b>Scrum Master: -(yes/no)- yes</b>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Area Leader: -(yes/no)- yes</b>
 * 
 * <h2>1. Notes</h2>
 * 
 * -Notes about the week's work.-
 * <p>
 * -In this section you should register important notes regarding your work during the week.
 * For instance, if you spend significant time helping a colleague or if you work in more than a feature.-
 *
 * <h2>2. Use Case/Feature: Core01.1</h2>
 * 
 * Issue in Jira: http://jira.dei.isep.ipp.pt:8080/browse/LPFOURDG-113
 * <p>
 * LPFOURDG-113 Core01.1: Enable and Disable Extensions
 * 
 * <h2>3. Requirement</h2>
 * Enabling or disabling extensions of the Cleansheets. When disabling the extension, all of its features must be disable too.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Use Case "Enable or disable extensions":</b> The User initiates the enable or disable extensions use case. The system shows all the extensions of the cleansheet in a list each one with a "check box" attached to it. The user checks the extensions that he/she wants to enable, and unchecks the ones that wants to disable. The System saves all the information and display the correct extensions. 
 * 
 *  
 * <h2>4. Analysis</h2>
 * 
 * 
 * <h3>First "analysis" sequence diagram</h3>
 * The following diagram depicts a proposal for the realization of the previously described use case. We call this diagram an "analysis" use case realization because it functions like a draft that we can do during analysis or early design in order to get a previous approach to the design. For that reason we mark the elements of the diagram with the stereotype "analysis" that states that the element is not a design element and, therefore, does not exists as such in the code of the application (at least at the moment that this diagram was created).

 * 
 * <h3>Analysis of Core Technical Problem</h3>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_pattern">delegation design pattern</a> is used in the cell extension mechanism of cleansheets. The following class diagram depicts the relations between classes in the "Cell" hierarchy.
 * <p>
 * <img src="doc-files/core02_01_analysis_cell_delegate.png" alt="image"> 
 * 
 * <p>
 * One important aspect is how extensions are dynamically created and returned. The <code>Extensible</code> interface has only one method, <code>getExtension</code>. Any class, to be extensible, must return a specific extension by its name. The default (and base) implementation for the <code>Cell</code> interface, the class <code>CellImpl</code>, implements the method in the following manner:
 * <pre>
 * {@code 
 * 	public Cell getExtension(String name) {
 *		// Looks for an existing cell extension
 *		CellExtension extension = extensions.get(name);
 *		if (extension == null) {
 *			// Creates a new cell extension
 *			Extension x = ExtensionManager.getInstance().getExtension(name);
 *			if (x != null) {
 *				extension = x.extend(this);
 *				if (extension != null)
 *					extensions.put(name, extension);
 *			}
 *		}
 *		return extension;
 *	}
 * }
 * </pre>
 * As we can see from the code, if we are requesting a extension that is not already present in the cell, it is applied at the moment and then returned. The extension class (that implements the <code>Extension</code> interface) what will do is to create a new instance of its cell extension class (this will be the <b>delegator</b> in the pattern). The constructor receives the instance of the cell to extend (the <b>delegate</b> in the pattern). For instance, <code>StylableCell</code> (the delegator) will delegate to <code>CellImpl</code> all the method invocations regarding methods of the <code>Cell</code> interface. Obviously, methods specific to <code>StylableCell</code> must be implemented by it.
 * Therefore, to implement a cell that can have a associated comment we need to implement a class similar to <code>StylableCell</code>.
 * 
 * <h2>5. Design</h2>
 *
 * <h3>5.1. Functional Tests</h3>
 * <p>
 * Basically, from requirements and also analysis, we see that the core functionality of this use case is to be able to add an attribute to cells to be used to store a comment/text. We need to be able to set and get its value.
 * Following this approach we can start by coding a unit test that uses a subclass of <code>CellExtension</code> with a new attribute for user comments with the corresponding method accessors (set and get). A simple test can be to set this attribute with a simple string and to verify if the get method returns the same string.
 * As usual, in a test driven development approach tests normally fail in the beginning. The idea is that the tests will pass in the end. 
 * </p>
 * see: <code>csheets.ext.comments.CommentableCellTest</code>
 *
 * <h3>5.2. UC Realization</h3>
 * To realize this user story we will need to create a subclass of Extension. We will also need to create a subclass of UIExtension. For the sidebar we need to implement a JPanel. In the code of the extension <code>csheets.ext.style</code> we can find examples that illustrate how to implement these technical requirements.
 * The following diagrams illustrate core aspects of the design of the solution for this use case.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> It is very important that in the final version of this technical documentation the elements depicted in these design diagrams exist in the code!
 * </p>
 * <h3>Extension Setup</h3>
 * The following diagram shows the setup of the "comments" extension when cleansheets is run.
 * <p>
 * <img src="doc-files/core02_01_design.png" alt="image">
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>User Selects a Cell</h3>
 * The following diagram illustrates what happens when the user selects a cell. The idea is that when this happens the extension must display in the sidebar the comment of that cell (if it exists).
 * <p>
 * <img src="doc-files/core02_01_design2.png" alt="image">
 * </p>
 * <h3>User Updates the Comment of a Cell</h3>
 * The following diagram illustrates what happens when the user updates the text of the comment of the current cell. To be noticed that this diagram does not depict the actual selection of a cell (that is illustrated in the previous diagram).

 * 
 * <h2>8. Final Remarks</h2>
 * 
 * -In this section present your views regarding alternatives, extra work and future work on the issue.-
 * <p>
 * As an extra this use case also implements a small cell visual decorator if the cell has a comment. This "feature" is not documented in this page.
 * </p>

 * 
 * <h3>10.1. Design and Implementation:3</h3>
 * 
 * 3- bom: os testes cobrem uma parte significativa das funcionalidades (ex: mais de 50%) e apresentam código que para além de não ir contra a arquitetura do cleansheets segue ainda as boas práticas da área técnica (ex: sincronização, padrões de eapli, etc.)
