CleanSheets is a spreadsheet application for the Java platform, featuring Excel-style formulas and an extension mechanism. The application requires the Java 2 Platform Standard Edition 5.0 to compile and run. <br/>
This is a special fork from the original CleanSheets project that is used in the LAPR4 course of the Informatics Engineering undergraduate program at ISEP (http://www.isep.pt).<br/> 
Questions and comments can be addressed to Alexandre Braganca (atb@isep.ipp.pt).

This sections explains some important technical aspects of the LAPR4 project. <br/>
<br/>

<b>Technical Documentation</b><br/>
The technical documentation of the project is the one presented in this collection of html files that was generated by javadoc. Javadoc is a tool (included in the java sdk) that essentially generates the technical documentation from special comments on the source code of the project.<br/>
Therefore, the technical documentation that javadoc usually produces regards documentation about elements of the code (classes, methods, etc.). For this kind of project this is not enough since a very important part of the technical documentation regards aspects that relate to other stages of the software development process, like analysis and design. In these cases, documentation usually does not directly relate to code elements. Formats such as narrative text or visual diagrams are used (e.g., UML diagrams).<br/>
Since javadoc does not provide direct support to generate UML diagrams a tool named PlanUML (plantuml.sourceforge.net) was adopted to generate the diagrams and incorporate them in the html that is generated with javadoc.<br/>
PlantUML is not a drawing tool, it is a tool that generates diagrams from textual descriptions of the diagrams, by using a simple and intuitive textual language.<br/> 
These textual descriptions of the diagrams can be incorporated in comments, near the javadoc comments. Javadoc directives can then reference the diagrams (since plantuml will generate an image for each diagram).<br/>
All the documentation presented in these html files was generate from javadoc comments inside the java source files of the project (with plantuml diagrams) except for this page (javadoc-overview.html) that is the main and default page (and is not generated by javadoc but is included in the folder containing the generated documentation).<br/> 
By following this approach it becomes more easy to maintain the documentation in synch with the code and always in control by the DVCS (Distributed Version Control System).<br/>  
The PlanUML jar is included in the project (in the lib folder). PlanUML requires that Graphviz (http://www.graphviz.org/) be installed in the system for the generation of all types of diagrams except sequence diagrams.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Design</b><br/>
Cleansheets uses a lot of design patterns. You should study carefully its code to identify and learn how several design patterns - that you have studied in other courses of the Informatics Engineering program - were applied.<br/>
We invite you to use an IDE (Netbeans or Eclipse) to debug the application and learn the code.<br/>
You will see that one of the principles of the extension mechanism of cleansheets is also known as the hollywood principle: "don't call us, we will call you". This principle is widely used in frameworks and is known as the Inversion of Control (IOC) pattern. In this pattern "your" code don't call the framework (base) code, the framework code will call "your" code when needed.<br/>   
<br/>
<b>The structure of the repository</b><br/>
This section describes the artifacts that compose the project (files and folders).<br/>
These are the main artifacts:<br/>
- <b>readme.md</b>: This file contains the "must read before all things" information. For instance it should state how to generate and open this documentation.<br/>
- <b>src</b>: This folder contains the java source code of the project.<br/>
- <b>grammar</b>: This folder contains the grammar files of the project.<br/>
- <b>src-resources</b>: This folder contains other artifacts that are used/necessary to configure or build the project but are not java source files (e.g., image files, property files)<br/>
- <b>src-tests</b>: This folder contains the source code for the unit tests<br/>
- <b>scripts</b>: This folder contains scripts that can be used to execute several tasks (e.g., build the cleanseets jar, generate the technical documentation)<br/>
- <b>lib</b>: This folder contains dependencies that are required for building cleansheets. Initially antlr.jar, junit-4.10.jar and plantuml.jar.<br/>
- <b>legal</b>: Legal information regarding the Cleansheets project.<br/>
- <b>doc</b>: This folder contains files related to the technical documentation that are not generated from the javadoc comments in the source files. The documentation generated from javadoc is created in the subfolder "api" (which is not required to be in the DVCS because it is generated)<br/>
- <b>dist</b>: This folder should contain all files that are required to execute cleansheets. Initially it contains antlr.jar and csheets.jar. Since these files result from the building process they are not required to be controlled by the DVCS.<br/>
- <b>tmp-build</b>: This folder contains the output of the building process. It should not be in the DVCS.<br/>
- <b>tmp-build-tests</b>: This folder contains the output of building the junit tests. It should not be in the DVCS.<br/>
These are the artifacts specific of eclipse:<br/>
- <b>.classpath</b>: This file contains several paths of the eclipse project<br/>
- <b>.project</b>: This is the main project file of the eclipse project<br/>
- <b>res</b>: This folder contains de result of the building process of eclipse. It should not be in the DVCS.<br/>
These are the artifacts specific of netbeans:<br/>
- <b>nbproject</b>: This is the main folder for the netbeans project<br/>
- <b>nbproject/private</b>: This subfolder is not required to be tracked by the DVCS<br/>
- <b>build.xml</b>: This file is auto-generated by the netbeans. It should not be in the DVCS.<br/>
- <b>manifest.mf</b>: This subfolder is not required to be tracked by the DVCS<br/>
- <b>build</b>: This folder contains the result of the netbeans building process. It should not be tracked by the DVCS<br/>
- <b>nbdist</b>: This folder is not required to be tracked by the DVCS<br/>
- <b>lib/nblibraries.properties</b>: This is required for Netbeans<br/>
These are the artifacts required for the DVCS (Git):<br/>
- <b>.gitignore</b>: This file contains entries that specify files or folders that we want to exclude from the DVCS<br/>
- <b>.git</b>: This folder contains all the data of the repository<br/>
<br/>
<b>Scripts</b><br/>
The project includes scripts that are used to accomplish several tasks in the project. Even if the team uses netbeans or eclipse as an environment for the development process it should always maintain the scripts updated. <b>The scripts will always be used for presentation of the project and for assessment.</b><br/>
The project comes with scripts for Linux and Mac OS (.sh) and for Windows (.bat). Team members should keep the scripts up-to-date.<br/>
Scripts should be executed within a terminal/console and with the "scripts" folder as current folder<br/>
To build the Cleansheets jar:<br/>
./cc.sh - this generates lexer and parser code from the .g files<br/>
./makejar.sh - this compiles the java code (by calling build.sh); adds the resource files; creates the csheets.jar file and updates the dist folder<br/>
To run cleansheets (from the builded csheets.jar in the dist folder):<br/>
./run.sh<br/>
To build the technical documentation of the project:<br/>
./makeuml.sh - builds the diagrams (images) from their descriptions inside java comments and in javadoc-overview.html.<br/>
./makedoc.sh - buils the javadoc documentation of the project from the javadoc comments it encounters in the java source code of the project<br/>
To build the unit tests of the project:<br/>
./build_tests.sh - compiles the junit tests<br/>
./run_tests.sh - runs the junit tests<br/>
To run a simple console to experiment formulas<br/>
./console.sh<br/>
To clean all the contents of folders that only contain generated files (dist, tmp-build, tmp-build-tests)<br/>
./clean.sh<br/>

<!-- Place here documentation regarding the start of the application -->
</br>
The following diagram illustrates how the application starts. Particularly, it illustrates the initial loading of extensions by the application.<br/>
The extensions of the application are "special" classes that are registered in specific property files as denoted by the diagram.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Finally (but also within the main method) the user interface is created.<br/>
The following diagram depicts this last setup task.<br/>
The MenuBar class will build the menu options. These menu options include not only the base menu options but also menu options that may have been declared by the application extensions.<br/>
